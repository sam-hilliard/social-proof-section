## My process

I first layed out the HTML and planned my class names. Then, linked a stylesheet with all of the
colors from the style-guide declared as variables. I also did my normal CSS resets and started by
coloring and getting the typography in order. Then I focused on the mobile layout (I strictly believe
in mobile-first implementation as it's easier to start with and adapt a more complex layout to). Then,
I created the necessary changes for the desktop layout.

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This challenge proved an excellent practice for layouts created by flex box and grid. I struggled
a lot with getting the layout as close to the design as possible so I learned a lot in the process :).

Specifically, I gained more of an understaning of when to use flexbox vs grid after playing around with
both. I also gained a more solid understanding of alignment properties of flexbox.

Bottom line: Use grid for layouts in general and flexbox when you need to align things better within the
grid (unless you can do the aligning with the grid as well). This is just my take after this experience.


### Useful resources

- [Flexbox alignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container) - This article gave me a refresher on how to control alignment along both axises of a flex container.
